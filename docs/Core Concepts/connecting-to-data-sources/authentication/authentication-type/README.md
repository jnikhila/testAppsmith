# Authentication Type

The API authentication is a process of validating the consumer's identity who attempts to make a connection by using an authentication protocol. The authentication type defines the available authentication protocols that you can use on Appsmith to make a connection with your APIs.

Configure one of the below authentication modes and save it.

{% content-ref url="basic-authentication.md" %}
[basic-authentication.md](basic-authentication.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="oauth2-authentication/" %}
[oauth2-authentication](oauth2-authentication/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
