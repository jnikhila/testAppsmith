## License Renewal

```
Exiting application. Invalid license key.
```

Please get in touch with our support team either on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rBTTVJp) or by [email](mailto:support@appsmith.com) to renew your license.

Once you have a new license key, [replace the existing license key](docker.md#step3-add-or-replace-license-key) in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
