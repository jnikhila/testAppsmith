# Auth0

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is an authentication and authorization as a service provider. To configure OpenID Connect(OIDC) within Appsmith using Auth0 as an OIDC provider, follow these steps:

{% hint style="info" %}
OpenID Connect is available **only in the** [**enterprise edition**](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing) for **self-hosted instances**, and only the **Superuser** of your **Appsmith Instance** can set up **OIDC**.
{% endhint %}

### Create Application

* Log in to your [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) account and go to **Applications**. (Please create an account if you don’t have one on [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)).

### Configuring Scopes for Auth0

The scope defines the OpenID Connect (OIDC) scopes that allow you to authorize the access of user details (after a user is successfully authenticated) like name, email, profile picture, and more. Each scope maps to a set of user attributes and returns its value. Just below the **JSON Web Key Set,** you’ll see the **Scope** field:

![Configure one or more scopes at Appsmith](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Appsmith-Scope-Field (1).png>)

#### What does Appsmith need as part of Scopes?

Appsmith needs **openId** and **email** as mandatory scopes. You can add more scopes if the need be. You'll have to ensure that the same is available at Auth0.

#### Auth0 Scope

Auth0 provides standard claims: openId, profile, and email as part of the authorization action. If you want to access [additional user attributes, you’ll have to configure them on the Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/scopes/openid-connect-scopes) and add them to Appsmith as part of the Scope field.

### Configuring Username Attributes for Auth0

The username attributes define the attributes used as usernames for authentication. You can add the attribute to this field that you consider for logging.

![Configure Username Attribute at Appsmith](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Appsmith-UsernameAttribute-Field.png)

#### What does Appsmith need as a Username Attribute?

Appsmith considers **email address** as **username**. Please ensure that you have added it as an attribute in the Username Attribute field. Please provide **email** as the attribute name for configuring the username attribute for Auth0.

### Complete OIDC Setup

* Save the changes and restart your application by clicking `SAVE & RESTART` button.
