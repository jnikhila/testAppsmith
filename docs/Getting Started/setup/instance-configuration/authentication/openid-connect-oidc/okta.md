# Okta

Okta is an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) provider. To configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) within Appsmith using Okta, follow these steps:

{% hint style="info" %}
OpenID Connect is available **only in the** [**enterprise edition**](https://www.appsmith.com/pricing) for **self-hosted instances**, and only the **Superuser** of your **Appsmith Instance** can set up **OIDC**.
{% endhint %}

### **Create Application**

* Log in to your [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com) and go to **Applications**. (Please create an account if you don’t have one).

* Click on **Create App integration**. In Create App integration window, choose **OIDC** as the Sign-in method and **Web application** as the Application type. Click on Next.

* In the **General settings** of the newly created App Integration:
  * Give your App integration a meaningful name (Optional.)

### Configure Scopes for Okta

The scope defines the OpenID Connect (OIDC) scopes that allow you to authorize the access of user details ( after a user is successfully authenticated) like name, email, profile picture, and more. Each scope maps to a set of user attributes and returns its value. Just below the **JSON Web Key Set,** you’ll see the **Scope** field:

![Configure Scope(s) at Appsmith](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Appsmith-Scope-Field.png)

#### What does Appsmith need as part of Scopes?

Appsmith needs **openId** as a mandatory scope. You can add more scopes if the need be. You'll have to ensure that the same is available at Okta.

#### Okta Scope

Okta provides a number of [configurable scopes](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/main/) that can be granted based on your business requirements. Navigate to **Okta API Scopes**, where you’ll be able to grant all or selected scopes.

### Configure Username Attributes for Okta

The username attributes define the attributes used as usernames for authentication. You can add the attribute to this field that you consider for logging.

![Appsmith Username Attribute](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Appsmith-UsernameAttribute-Field.png)

#### What does Appsmith need as a Username Attribute?

Appsmith considers **email address** as **username**. Please ensure that you have added it as an attribute in the Username Attribute field. Please provide **email** as the attribute name for configuring the username attribute for Okta.
